# BobbleHead Wars



## Changes from original tutorial

-- Added free camera controls, controlled by mouse movement

-- Changed player movement from World space to local (Player) space

-- Animated all arena walls seperately 

--Added navmesh obstacles to arena walls
 - Aliens now do not walk through walls (most of the time, they're tricky little buggers)

-- Altered wall collision to be between camera and wall instead of player and wall
    - This was a result of allowing for camera rotation
    
-- Added a general Object Pooler 
- Items that are pooled: only projectiles currently
